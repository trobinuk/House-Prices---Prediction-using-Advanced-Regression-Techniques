# House-Prices---Prediction-using-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

Predictive data analytics is nothing but applying Machine Learning technique to the data that we already have in-order to predict the future like what kind of movies, products that people are going to be interested in. In this Project I am predicting the house prices for the features it possesses, the location it is present, the year it's been built etc. I have a historical data which has the SalePrice and the features and, I am going to analyse the data and teach the model to learn from it. And then using that model to find or predict the SalesPrice of houses which I do not know. Also, as an extension to this I also performed some ETL operations in the Cloud using the free-tier services offered by AWS cloud like Lambda function, S3 bucket, EC2 - Ubuntu server, RDS - MYSQL database and compute the result in the cloud.
